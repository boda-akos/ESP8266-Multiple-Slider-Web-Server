# ESP8266-Multiple-Slider-Web-Server
ESP8266 webserver example with 3 sliders.  Expandable.
Forked from : https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-servo-motor-web-server-arduino-ide/
The example shows 3 sliders, but it could be extended to any number. 
Sliders are indexed in a rude manner (added 2 numeric characters for index), and the Get function decoder extracts the index and the value.
Slider values are stored in slider[index] array.
